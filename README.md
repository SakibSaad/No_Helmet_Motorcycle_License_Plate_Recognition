# No_Helmet_Motorcycle_License_Plate_Recognition

## Description
The "No Helmet Motorcycle License Plate Recognition System" is an advanced project aimed at enhancing road safety by identifying motorcyclists without helmets and capturing their license plate information in real-time. It utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect helmetless riders, extract license plate data, and alert authorities for enforcement. Key features include helmet detection, license plate recognition, real-time monitoring, database integration, alerts, analytics, and scalability. Benefits include improved road safety, efficient enforcement, and data-driven decision-making for policymakers. In addition to the features of the "No Helmet Motorcycle License Plate Recognition System," this project includes mechanisms to detect excessive noise levels and automatically close the road by deploying a barrier when necessary.
